# Assignment 4 Advanced Question

From the scatter plot of AGE vs BMI, there is a clear trend towards increasing BMI with AGE,
although higher BMI occurs more at ages over 25 and below 70.  The
difference between male and female is difficult to see in this plot, however, in the 3D plot
of SEX vs BMI vs AGE, the shape of the female plot appears to have higher BMI at lower ages,
while the BMI in males increases more with age, so I think this plot is greater, but to
see the trends the scatter plot helps to clarify it.
